# Simple Chat Application

This project is a basic chat application built using Python, allowing multiple clients to connect and communicate with each other through a server. Developed under the guidance of Mrs. Shwetha, this application demonstrates the use of socket programming and multithreading in Python.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication:** Enables real-time messaging between multiple clients.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Utilizes a server to manage client connections and message broadcasting.
- **Multithreading:** Handles multiple clients simultaneously without blocking the server.

## Components Used

- **Python Socket Library:** For creating network connections.
- **Threading Module:** To manage multiple threads for handling client connections concurrently.
